/*Where & Distinct
Implement the GetFridaysOfYear method, which given a collection of dates and a number representing the year,
returns a collection of all dates from this collection that are Fridays (without duplicates).

For example, for the following dates and year 2023:

24.03.2023 (Friday)

24.03.2023 (Friday) -> will be excluded as duplicate

25.03.2023 (Saturday) -> will be excluded as not a Friday

31.03.2023 (Friday)

08.03.2024 (Friday) -> will be excluded because it's not from the given year

The result shall be:

24.03.2023 (Friday)

31.03.2023 (Friday)

Tip: The DateTime object has a DayOfWeek property of the DayOfWeek enum type.*/
